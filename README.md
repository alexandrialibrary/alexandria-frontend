##Usage
To test the site locally you will need a simple server. Conveniently, there is a Node.js project called [Simple Server](https://github.com/balupton/simple-server) that does just this.

**Install Simple Server**
```shell
$ npm install -g simple-server
```

**Serve the current directory at port 3000**
```shell
$ simple-server ./ 3000
```
The project will now be available at [`http://localhost:3000/index.html`](http://localhost:3000/index.html).
